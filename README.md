# Tata Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights

This project was completed as part of a virtual job simulation with Tata Consultancy Services via Forage in June 2025.

## Project Overview

The goal of this simulation was to help a fictional online retail client identify key revenue insights and expansion opportunities by preparing visuals and analysis for the CEO and CMO.

## Key Tasks Completed

1. **Framed Business Questions**  
   - Drafted relevant questions for the CEO and CMO focusing on revenue, customer behavior, and regional performance.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed invalid records (e.g., negative quantity or unit price).
   - Filtered for relevant dates (2011 only) and removed returns.

3. **Dashboard Development** (using Tableau)
   - Created four dashboards for:
     - Monthly revenue trend (Q1)
     - Top 10 countries by revenue (excluding UK) (Q2)
     - Top 10 customers by revenue (Q3)
     - Global demand analysis by country (Q4)

4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Identified strong seasonality in last quarter of 2011.
   - Suggested geographic focus for expansion (Netherlands, Germany, France, etc.)
   - Noted customer diversity minimizes dependency on few top customers.
